## Note for Users and Developers
**THESE ARE JUST THE GITHUB NETWORKED ASSETS USED INSIDE OF FISHNET, NOT THE ACTUAL CLIENT ITSELF!** You need an invite to get the actual client itself, since it is private.

> For developers, You can use some of these assets inside of your menu if you want, but it is required to give credit (either "arol" or my github user for the credit) for non-personal clients that are either public or private as most of these assets were made by me.
>
> And don't try copying my shit using these assets or other assets, it's corny :sob:
